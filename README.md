## Why APICove?

APIs are the backbone of modern apps. But, let’s face it: managing them can be a pain. From time-consuming configurations to repetitive testing, developers are often stuck in tasks that slow down innovation.

**That’s where APICove steps in.** We’re on a mission to revolutionize your API workflow. Our tools help you build, test, and manage APIs more effectively—without code, without headaches.

We believe APIs should be as easy to use as they are powerful. With APICove, whether you’re creating APIs or consuming them, we’ve got your back.

## Challenging the Status Quo

We don’t just build tools—we **dogfood** them. We use our own tools daily as developers and continuously refine them through real-world testing (tree testing). The result? **Tools that solve real problems, not just theoretical ones.**

## APICove: Your API Hub

APICove isn’t just a tool—it’s a **hub** for the APIs that matter most. We’ve curated a list of **industry-standard APIs** that developers can rely on for enterprise applications. Each API comes with tutorials, resources, and the ability to test them using our built-in simulators.

Our focus? Deliver the essential APIs you need in one place, with easy access to documentation, real-world use cases, and the tools to make them work for you.

Do you think we’re missing an API that should be on the list? We’re all ears! **Contribute via pull requests** and help us build the most complete API hub.
