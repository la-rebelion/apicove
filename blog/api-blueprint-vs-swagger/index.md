I use Markdown for note taking, and for personal documentation, most of my SOP/MOP are Markdown based with scripts embeded, I am sure you use it as well, at least in your Git issues, but when it comes to API design with Markdown doesn't seem to be the best choice.

**Markdown or YAML/JSON - what's the right tool for your API design?**

API development has come a long way, and with it, so has the demand for tools that make it easier to design, document, and maintain APIs. Two notable names that developers often encounter are [**API Blueprint**](https://apiblueprint.org/) and [**Swagger**](https://swagger.io/specification/) (also known as OpenAPI). These tools, while different in their approach, both aim to improve the quality and clarity of APIs.

Why does Swagger overshadow API Blueprint in terms of popularity? And what can developers gain from using either tool?

While Markdown's simplicity and readability make it an attractive option for documentation and lightweight configurations, its limitations as a coding or configuration tool (stemming from its original design for content formatting rather than structured data) create challenges when compared to purpose-built formats like YAML and JSON. This article delves into the strengths and shortcomings of each format, evaluating their suitability for modern development workflows and helping readers determine the best choice for their projects.

Let's explore the strengths of each, why Swagger is more popular, and how both tools can be utilized to create better, more maintainable APIs.

## 1. API Blueprint: API Design for Humans
API Blueprint's tagline says it all: "API Design for Humans." At its core, API Blueprint emphasizes simplicity and readability. Here's why:

### Markdown-Driven Simplicity
One of the greatest advantages of API Blueprint is its **Markdown**-based format. Markdown is intuitive, human-readable, and widely understood. It allows developers to write API specifications naturally, without complex syntaxes, hence making it accessible to a broader audience, even those unfamiliar with API design tools, why not do the API design with Markdown?

For example, a simple API endpoint in API Blueprint might look like this:

```
# GET /users
+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Body
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe"
    }
```

Anyone with basic knowledge of APIs can immediately grasp what's happening here. There's no need to sift through verbose code or unfamiliar configurations. This Markdown-driven simplicity makes API Blueprint particularly useful for:

- **Human readability**: API specs are easy to write and understand, even for non-technical team members.
- **Self-documentation**: Because the format is clear, APIs effectively document themselves as they are created.

### Ease of Documentation
One of the most significant strengths of API Blueprint is how it integrates seamlessly with tools like **Docusaurus** or **Markdown Preview** to generate quick, publishable API documentation. Whether it's exporting to HTML or PDF, developers can create clean, user-friendly documentation in minutes.

For smaller projects or teams that value simplicity and readability, API Blueprint can still be a strong contender.

## 2. Swagger/OpenAPI: Power, Flexibility, and Ecosystem
If API Blueprint is all about simplicity, Swagger (now known as OpenAPI) is about **power and versatility**. Swagger has established itself as the de facto standard in API design, and there are several reasons for this.

### JSON and YAML for Modern Web Development
Unlike API Blueprint, which relies on Markdown, Swagger/OpenAPI is built around **JSON** and **YAML**. These formats are already standard in many development workflows, from Kubernetes configurations to infrastructure as code (IaC).

Here's a basic example of Swagger's syntax in YAML:

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  title: User API
  version: "1.0"
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Retrieves a list of users
      responses:
        "200":
          description: A list of users
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
```

For developers familiar with JSON or YAML, this format feels more natural to parse and handle in code. Swagger's structure also supports more complex API definitions with ease, including parameters, data models, and more.

### JSON Schema Integration
One of Swagger's standout features is its **native support for JSON Schema**, a widely used standard for defining and validating the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema allows developers to describe the shape, constraints, and validation rules of their API's request and response payloads.

In modern API development, JSON Schema is crucial for ensuring data consistency and validation, especially in microservices and large-scale applications. Swagger's tight integration with JSON Schema makes it easy to define API models, ensuring they are both human-readable and machine-validated.

### Ecosystem and Tooling
Swagger's **ecosystem** is one of its biggest advantages. It offers a comprehensive set of tools that extend far beyond API documentation. Here's what Swagger provides:

- **Swagger UI**: A real-time, interactive API documentation tool where developers can visualize and test API endpoints.
- **Code generation**: Swagger allows developers to auto-generate client and server code in multiple languages. This saves time and reduces the chances of human error when building APIs.
- **Testing and automation**: Tools like **SwaggerHub** integrate Swagger directly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing and deployment of APIs.

These tools streamline the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation to testing and deployment, making Swagger the go-to choice for teams that need robust solutions for large, complex projects.

## 3. Why Swagger Outshines API Blueprint
Given the strengths of API Blueprint, why has Swagger overtaken it in terms of popularity?

### Better Alignment with Modern Standards
As mentioned, Swagger's use of JSON and YAML aligns with modern development practices. JSON and YAML are already used extensively for configuration and data exchange in various contexts (e.g., Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, IaC), so Swagger fits naturally into these workflows. Markdown, while simpler, doesn't offer the same level of machine readability or compatibility with these tools.

### Corporate Backing and Community Support
Swagger has strong corporate backing from the **OpenAPI Initiative**, which includes major tech players like Google, Microsoft, and IBM. This backing has helped Swagger maintain a dominant position in the API space. Additionally, Swagger has a massive community of developers and contributors, ensuring it evolves with the industry's needs.

### Extensive Tooling
The sheer depth of Swagger's tooling - automated code generation, testing, validation, and more - gives it a significant edge over API Blueprint. While API Blueprint focuses on human-readability and documentation, Swagger tackles the entire API lifecycle, from design to deployment.

### Lack of Updates for API Blueprint
API Blueprint has not seen significant updates in several years. In contrast, Swagger is actively maintained and regularly updated to meet modern API standards. For developers who need ongoing support and improvements, Swagger is the more reliable choice.

## 4. Where API Blueprint Shines
Despite Swagger's dominance, API Blueprint still has its use cases, especially for smaller projects or teams that value readability and simplicity over extensive tooling. Some key advantages include:

- **Low barrier to entry**: For developers who prefer a more lightweight approach, API Blueprint's Markdown format is incredibly easy to pick up.
- **Quick documentation**: If your goal is to quickly document an API for internal use or to hand off to a small team, API Blueprint's simplicity is a big plus.
- **Non-technical collaboration**: API Blueprint can be useful for teams where non-developers (e.g., product managers or designers) need to understand and contribute to API documentation.

### Non-technical team members

I have to say, I love Markdown, and I use it for almost everything, but when it comes to API design, I prefer Swagger, it's more powerful and flexible, and it's the industry standard, but I can see the appeal of API Blueprint for smaller projects or teams that value simplicity and readability. 

Non-technical team members might find it easier to understand and contribute to API documentation written in Markdown. The clear, human-readable format of API Blueprint can also be a boon for quick, internal documentation.

Let's take a simple example of an API design with Markdown (from [API Blueprint website](https://apiblueprint.org/#built-for-better-api-designs)):

Non-technical team members might define the data structure like this:

```
# Data Structures

## Blog Post (object)
+ id: 42 (number, required)
+ text: Hello World (string)
+ author (Author) - Author of the blog post.

## Author (object)
+ name: Boba Fett
+ email: fett@intergalactic.com
```

And the technical team can take it from there, and define the API endpoints and responses:

```
# Blog Posts [/posts]

## Retrieve All Posts [GET]
+ Response 200 (application/json)
    + Attributes (array[Blog Post])
```

## 5. Enhancing API Quality Together
Ultimately, both API Blueprint and Swagger have their merits. Swagger's rich ecosystem, JSON Schema integration, and alignment with modern web development practices make it the preferred choice for most developers, especially in large, complex projects. However, API Blueprint's focus on human readability and simplicity can still make it a strong contender for smaller, more straightforward projects.

Rather than viewing them as competitors, developers can leverage the strengths of both tools depending on their project needs. For simpler APIs where quick documentation is a priority, API Blueprint offers a refreshing, Markdown-driven approach. For projects that require full lifecycle management, testing, and automation, Swagger is the clear choice.

In the end, both tools can help developers improve the quality of their APIs - whether through ease of documentation or powerful, automated workflows.
