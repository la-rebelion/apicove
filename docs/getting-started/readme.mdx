# Getting Started with APICove

Welcome! You're here because you're ready to accelerate your API development and testing with the `APICove` tools. This guide will walk you through the basics and get you up and running quickly.

## What is APICove?

`APICove` is a suite of tools designed to speed up the entire API lifecycle—from design to testing. Whether you're just starting out or deep in the development process, APICove tools can help streamline your workflow and reduce the manual work involved.

## The Tools

### GYAT: Go-Through Your API Tool

`GYAT` is a command-line tool that simplifies running API tests. It was built with ease of use in mind, inspired by the simplicity of the `kubectl` CLI tool.

With `GYAT`, you can run API tests from your terminal—no coding required. Whether you’re validating endpoints or querying APIs, `GYAT` offers a straightforward approach to getting your API tests done.

Go from this complex curl command:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/pets" -H "accept: application/json"
```

To this simple `GYAT` command:

```bash
gyat petstore get pets
```

### HAPI: Headless API

If you are not happy with all the manual work involved in writing the boilerplate code for API tests, mock servers, we created `HAPI` just for you.

`HAPI` is a _headless_ API tool that allows you to scaffold **your API server** without writing any code. With `HAPI`, you can quickly create a fully functional server, to streamline the full API lifecycle: design, development, and testing.

Many solutions exist to help you mock your API or to generate code from your OpenAPI spec file, but `HAPI` is unique in that it generates a fully functional server that you can run locally or deploy to the cloud. HAPI gives you more control, flexibility, and efficiency than standard API setups.

To get started with `HAPI`, check out the [HAPI getting started documentation](/docs/hapi/).

### APICove Studio Generator

The `APICove Studio Generator` helps you automatically generate API tests (using Jest or Mocha) from your OpenAPI spec file. Once generated, you can quickly integrate these tests into your project.

To see it in action, you can explore the [Mocha project template](https://github.com/la-rebelion/apicove-mocha-ts-project-template), which is available directly on GitHub CodeSpaces for quick testing.
