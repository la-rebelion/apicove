# Getting Started with APICove

Welcome! You're here because you're ready to accelerate your API development and testing with the `APICove` tools. This guide will walk you through the basics and get you up and running quickly.

## What is APICove?

`APICove` is a suite of tools designed to speed up the entire API lifecycleâ€”from design to testing. Whether you're just starting out or deep in the development process, APICove tools can help streamline your workflow and reduce the manual work involved.

## The Tools

### GYAT: Go-Through Your API Tool

`GYAT` is a command-line tool that simplifies running API tests. It was built with ease of use in mind, inspired by the simplicity of the `kubectl` CLI tool.

With `GYAT`, you can run API tests from your terminalâ€”no coding required. Whether youâ€™re validating endpoints or querying APIs, `GYAT` offers a straightforward approach to getting your API tests done.

### How to Get Started with GYAT

To get started with `GYAT`, you'll need two simple things:

1. **An OpenAPI specification file**: This describes the API youâ€™re working with. For beginners, you can use the [Petstore example](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml) API from the [Pet Store repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore).
2. **GYAT Configuration**: `GYAT` uses the same configuration format as `kubectl` (i.e., the `kubeconfig` file). This keeps the learning curve minimal and makes configuration easier.

### Example GYAT Commands

:::warning

`gyat` is at an early stage of development. There may be breaking changes in the future to the command usage, flags, and configuration file formats. If something doesn't work as expected, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://go.rebelion.la/apicove-feedback), or contribute to its development with your feedback. ðŸ¤“

:::

Here are some useful `GYAT` commands to get you started:

```bash {2,5,8,11,14,17,20}
# Display help and list available APIs
gyat info

# List available operations for a specific API
gyat petstore info -v

# Retrieve a resource (e.g., pet) by ID
gyat petstore get pet 10

# Retrieve a resource (e.g., pet) by ID and output it in JSON format
gyat petstore get pet 10 --o=json

# Retrieve a resource (e.g., pet) with verbose output
gyat petstore get pet 10 --o=json --v

# Pipe output to jq for further processing
gyat petstore get pet 10 --o=json | jq .

# Retrieve a resource (e.g., pet) by operation ID with query parameters and output in YAML format
gyat petstore get pet --operationId=findPetsByStatus --status=available --o=yaml
```

For more information, check out the [GYAT documentation](/docs/gyat/).

* **Download**: You can download the latest version of `GYAT` from the [GitHub releases page](https://go.rebelion.la/apicove-downloads).

### APICove Studio Generator

The `APICove Studio Generator` helps you automatically generate API tests (using Jest or Mocha) from your OpenAPI spec file. Once generated, you can quickly integrate these tests into your project.

To see it in action, you can explore the [Mocha project template](https://github.com/la-rebelion/apicove-mocha-ts-project-template), which is available directly on GitHub CodeSpaces for quick testing.
