# Installation and Configuration

Welcome to the `GYAT` installation and configuration guide! This guide will walk you through the steps to install `GYAT` and configure it for your API testing needs.

## Installation

To install `GYAT`, you can download the latest version from the [GitHub releases page](https://go.rebelion.la/apicove-downloads). The installation process is straightforward and requires minimal setup.

## Configuration

Once you've installed `GYAT`, you'll need to configure it to work with your API. The configuration process is simple and involves setting up the following:

1. **OpenAPI Specification File**: This file describes the API you're working with. For beginners, you can use the [Petstore example](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml) API from the [Pet Store repository](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore).
2. **GYAT Configuration**: `GYAT` uses the same configuration format as `kubectl` (i.e., the `kubeconfig` file). This keeps the learning curve minimal and makes configuration easier.
