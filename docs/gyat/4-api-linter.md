Linting is the process of running a program that will analyze code for potential errors. In the context of APIs, linting is used to ensure that the API is following best practices and adhering to the API design guidelines. Linting can help identify potential issues early in the development process, which can save time and effort in the long run.

## Why Lint Your API?

Linting your API has several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Linting helps ensure that your API follows a consistent style and structure, making it easier to read and maintain.
2. **Best Practices**: Linting can help enforce best practices and coding standards, ensuring that your API is well-designed and easy to use.
3. **Error Prevention**: Linting can help identify potential issues and errors in your API code, allowing you to fix them before they become bigger problems.
4. **Code Quality**: Linting can help improve the overall quality of your API code, making it more reliable and robust.
